# Chanflip Node Tutorial


Using the root user to run a Validator works. However, it is a good security practice to create a separate user with limited access to run the Chainflip binaries.
You can call the new user whatever you like. In the following commands we will call it ``flip.``


### Create the User
```
sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/flip/ -m -G sudo flip
```

### Add a Password
```
sudo passwd flip
```

## Setup SSH Access
```
mkdir /home/flip/.ssh
sudo cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/flip/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chown -R flip:flip /home/flip/.ssh/
sudo chmod 0700 /home/flip/.ssh/
```

Next time you want to SSH into your server using the user you created, you can run: 
```
ssh flip@<YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>
```

### Login For Flip User
```
su - flip
```


## Getting the Validator Software

### Download Binaries Via APT Repo
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL repo.chainflip.io/keys/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg
```

Verify the key's authenticity:
```
gpg --show-keys /etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg
```
#### Important: ``Make sure you see the following output from the terminal.``
```
pub   rsa3072 2022-11-08 [SC] [expires: 2024-11-07]
      BDBC3CF58F623694CD9E3F5CFB3E88547C6B47C6
uid                      Chainflip Labs GmbH <dev@chainflip.io>
sub   rsa3072 2022-11-08 [E] [expires: 2024-11-07]
```
After that, add Chainflip's Repo to apt sources list:
```
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg] https://repo.chainflip.io/perseverance/ focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chainflip.list
```


### Installing The Packages
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y chainflip-cli chainflip-node chainflip-engine
```


## Generating the Key
```
sudo mkdir /etc/chainflip/keys
```

#### ``If there is a 0x on the front, remove it before running the command.``
```
echo -n "YOUR_VALIDATOR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY" |  sudo tee /etc/chainflip/keys/ethereum_key_file
```
#### You must ensure that the public address administered by the private key at the above location has at least 0.1 gETH. Make sure you send 0.1 gETH to this account's address before trying to stake. This requirement is subject to change based on Goerli Ethereum transaction fees but for now should be sufficient.


## Validator Keys
In order to stake the node, you are going to need some Chainflip keys. You can generate them with the chainflip-node binary.

## Generating Signing Keys
You can generate keys for Chainflip using the following command:
```
chainflip-node key generate
```

It should give you some output like the below:
```
Secret phrase:       XXX
  Network ID:        2112
  Secret seed:       0xXXX  # This is your private key. Hold onto it.
  Public key (hex):  0xXXX
  Account ID:        0xXXX 
  Public key (SS58): cFXXX # This is your Validator ID. Make sure you have it handy for staking.
  SS58 Address:      cFXXX
```

#### Make sure to backup all of these values. You will need them again in order to stake your node. If your node ever gets taken down by your hosting provider, you will need these values to stop your funds getting slashed. DO NOT LOSE THEM.


## Loading Your Signing Keys
The following command saves the seed into a variable called SECRET_SEED:
```
SECRET_SEED=YOUR_CHAINFLIP_SECRET_SEED
```

And this command saves it to a file called: `signing_key_file`` without the first two characters (the ``0x``):
```
echo -n "${SECRET_SEED:2}" | sudo tee /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file
```

### Generating a Node Key
Finally, we need to do a similar process one more time. We need to generate a separate key that is used for secure communication between Validators. This time run:
```
sudo chainflip-node key generate-node-key --file /etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file
```

You can check that the command worked by running the following command:
```
cat /etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file
```

You should see the contents of the files printed to your terminal.


### Back Them Up & Copy Your Validator ID
Now you should have three separate keys loaded onto your validator. Your Ethereum Keys, your Signing Keys (your main Validator ID), and your Node Key. In case this wasn't already abundantly clear, you should ensure that you have a copy of all of your keys. They cannot be recovered by Chainflip if you are to lose them. If you lose them, you are almost certainly going to lose (test) money.
### Cleaning Up After Yourself
The following commands will ensure that only the current user can read the files, and that the private keys are not available in your shell history:
```
sudo chmod 600 /etc/chainflip/keys/ethereum_key_file
sudo chmod 600 /etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file
sudo chmod 600 /etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file
history -c
```


## CONFIGURATION FILE

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/chainflip/config
sudo nano /etc/chainflip/config/Default.toml
```

Editing the Config
Copy the following to your nano editor. You also need to replace IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_NODE with the public IP Address of your server. To get the public IP of your node you can run this command: curl -w "\n" ifconfig.me. Also you'll need to provide the ws_node_endpoint, and http_node_endpoint for whichever Ethereum client you've selected.
```
# Default configurations for the CFE
[node_p2p]
node_key_file = "/etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file"
ip_address="IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_NODE"
port = "8078"

[state_chain]
ws_endpoint = "ws://127.0.0.1:9944"
signing_key_file = "/etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file"

[eth]
# Ethereum RPC endpoints (websocket and http for redundancy).
ws_node_endpoint = "WSS_ENDPOINT_FROM_ETHEREUM_CLIENT"
http_node_endpoint = "HTTPS_ENDPOINT_FROM_ETHEREUM_CLIENT"

# Ethereum private key file path. This file should contain a hex-encoded private key.
private_key_file = "/etc/chainflip/keys/ethereum_key_file"

[signing]
db_file = "/etc/chainflip/data.db"
```

### Saving the File
Once you're happy with your configuration file and have inserted a valid endpoint address, exit and save the file by using ``CTRL(Control)+x`` and when prompted type ``Y`` then hit ``Enter``.

## Start Up
To start the chainflip-node, run the following command.
```
sudo systemctl start chainflip-node
```
To check on the service, we use status.
```
sudo systemctl status chainflip-node
```

To view the live logs for the validator software, check on them via tail. You can quit at anytime using ``ctrl/control + c``
Check the Node:
```
tail -f /var/log/chainflip-node.log
```

Once the node has finished syncing, we can start up the engine.
To start the chainflip-engine, we issue another command.
```
sudo systemctl start chainflip-engine
```
To check on the service, we use status.
```
sudo systemctl status chainflip-engine
```
Finally, tell both the services to start again after a reboot:
```
sudo systemctl enable chainflip-node
```
```
sudo systemctl enable chainflip-engine
```

Check the engine logs:
```
tail -f /var/log/chainflip-engine.log
```
